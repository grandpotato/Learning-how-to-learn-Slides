Because I'm learning that too through the Coursera Data Science Specialisation in hopes to build skills as a data scientist.\n\n##About this pack\nThe content of this pack is designed to serve as a summary or a cheat sheet. \n\nThe course itself was (cleverly) designed to using the lessons taught in the course. I reccommend going hrough the course to get a feel for a material and to use this pack as reference only.\n\nOccasionally you'll see italics like this *KH: a thought*. These are my thoughts and musings about the subject matter.\n\nThanks for reading, learning, and caring for your future.\n\nLets go!\n\n##Contents\n- Focused vs Diffuse Learning  \n- Procrastination Memory, Sleep\n- Chunking the Essentials\n- Seeing the bigger picture\n- Procrastination\n- Memory\n- Renaissance Learning and unlocking your Potential I\n- Renaissance Learning and unlocking your Potential II\n\n#Focused vs Diffuse Learning\n\n\n##Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes \nYou are only able to be in one of the two following modes of thinking at a time.\n\n###Focused Learning\nWhen there are a limited number of ideas that your mind can managed at a time. It requires intense concentration and is helpful to execute a process or idea you know well. Metaphors are especially useful to build mental hooks as you can link it to other senses ie sight, smell, sound, touch which is much more powerful in your memory.\n\n###Diffuse learning\nWhen your mind is more relaxed. Perhaps focused on something else. But allows tthe ideas explored during the focused learning mode to be creatively combined. This is especially useful when exploring new ideas or concepts.\n\n##Using the focused and diffuse Modes - Or, a little Dali will do you\nSalvidor Dali and Thomas Edison were great utilisers of the diffuse modes of thinking. They'd work hard and when they needed a break they'd sit in their chair with a key (or ball bearing) in their hand until they nearly fall asleep and they'd drop the object. That would wake them up and they'd immediately jump back into focused modes of thinking.\n\nLearning takes time and spending that time and effort to grapple new ideas in both modes of thinking is an essential part of that exercise.\n\n##What is learning?\nUsing brain imaging you can see different parts of your brain light up under different circumstances. When you're focused the areas around the edges of the brain light up. When you're resting the inner part of your brain \"default mode network\" light up. *KH:Is this where our habits live?*\n\nYour brain is a living organ. When you sleep new dendrites are created along synapses. Especially after focused learning. Its like getting an upgrade of your brain each time you sleep. \n\n#Procrastination, Memory and Sleep\n##A Procrastination Review\nWhen you think about doing a task that you would rather not do. The pain areas of your brain light up.\nThis is procrastination and you seek out distractions *KH: reddit, youtube, facebook, emails etc* that your brain feels better when you do them.\n\nInterestingly if you go ahead and do the task anyway the pain points disappear quickly.\n\nThis is why the pomodoro technique is effective. Just set a timer and sit down for 25mins and do the task. At the end of the 25mins take a 5 minute break and reward yourself. This gets your brain used to doing small bits of work.\n\n##Practice Makes Permanent\n*KH: Barbara Oakley was not a natural at learning maths and science. This ties into Tim Ferris's\nadvice to learn from those who should not be good at something. They're the ones that would know how to get better best*\n\nWhen you want to learn something. Try it hard for a while, then take a break. Give some time for the mental motar in the mental wall to set. Before revising the material again. Don't cram or nothing will stick.\n\n*KH: for me one example is learning emtional language and mastery. Knowing how to harness and manage my emotions allows me to utilise them effectively to understand and achieve my goals.*\n\n##Introduction into memory\nThere are two types of memory. Working memory and long term memory. You can only hold about 4 things in your working memory at a time. So you can't really hold anymore than that many ideas while working in your focused mode. Also the ideas in your working memory are fragile so like remembering a long number you have to keep repeating them in your head or closing your eyes to remove distractions to try and remember them.\n\nIn long term memory you can have billions of things in there. But it takes time to get them out. So using spaced repetition is an effective way to maintain the memories in there. Its much better to repeat the recall of ideas over time than to pull them out the same number of times in one day.\n\n##The Importance of Sleep in Learning\nWhen you are awake your brain is producing toxins in your brain. By going to sleep your brain cells shrink to allow fluid to wash away the metabolic toxins. The toxins are linked to many negative outcomes and they also make your brain not work very well.\n\nWhen you sleep you brain also strengthens things you have tried to learn. To improve your chances of learning being focused on the topic right before you sleep helps your brain make connections. Even futrther if you make it intentional *KH: how does one actually do this??* that you will dream about what you were learning. You'll further increase your chances of an event.\n\nThis technique can make a remarkable difference in your ability to learn.\n\n#Chunking\n##What is a chunk\nA chunk is a group of neurons that represent a concept or idea that are used to firing together. Over time through repetition chunks can be grown to become more complex and encompassing. It does require your mind to be focussed to learn chunks. So you can't be tierd.\n\n##How to form a chunk part I\nWhen building chunks start small. \n\nFor example justinguitar starts by making you learnt the fingering for a chord. Then you learn the fingering for another chord. And then you practice the transition. In both directions. Then you practice a strum. With one chord. and then the next. and then while changing between the two chords.\n\nOr for a physical sport say handstands, you learn about hand position, bodyline, tucked tail, tight core and pointed toes. You do them separately and you work them together. Even the counter balancing exercises like shoulder break and finger push. Slowly each part gets knitted together into a chunk. You can form a larger chunk eventually by adding new handstang positions or entry methods. But its all built together bit by bit and slowly.\n\nBe careful of worked examples. If you understand the steps. You might forget to focus on the overall concept.\n\n##How to form a chunk part II\n1. Focus your undivided attention on the material you want to chunk\n2. Understand the concept first before details\n3. Hiding the material and then try to recall it. Understanding while reading is different from mastery.\n4. You MUST be able to do it yourself\n5. Context - Learn how this chunk works in different situations. When you use it and when NOT to use it\n6. A picture and a section heading walk before reading the chapter will help you learn the chunk. *KH: This is why abstracts and exec summaries are SO important. Limit them to 20mins of consumption*\n\n##Illusions of Competance\n- Just reading the text and \"understanding\" isn't a good method of learning. Recall and practice is MUCH more efective. (you can reread later in time to make it more like spaced repetition)\n- Going straight to concept maps also doesn't work well because the chunks of knowledge tying the concepts together have not been solidly formed\n- Highlighting and underlining must be done carefully. Do it minimally. *KH- I kinda do this anyway*\n- Recall (close the book and test yourself), rehersing is a good way of doing this in speeches.\n- Change the room you were doing the recall in when practicing. Your brain will pick up cues from those rooms subconciously and you'll require them for recall. By changing the environment you loosen the mental hooks to the enviroment and they become stronger with the material.\n\n#Seeing the Bigger Picture\n##What Motivates you?\nThere are 3 neural chemicals assocated with learning\n- Acetylcholine is produced to help you form connections in your focused mode\n- Dopamine is released during a reward or unexpected reward. we tap into this system using the pomodoro technique to get used to learning (also for the HIIT exercises)\n- Seretonin affects social life and risk taking behaviour. Leaders in monkey packs tend to have higher seretonin.\n\nYour emotions drive learning a lot (I liked being smart and being important knowing everything) which is probably why I studied hard as well as getting recognition at test and report card time.\n\n##The Value of a Library of Chunks\n- When you build a library your mind has more options and more combinations to thnk of creative solutions\n-Chunks can also grow and become bigger and more ingrained allowing you to understand even deeper subjects *KH: Keep an eye on progressions in knowledge. This is especially important when trying to understand if people are not at your level and you need to bring them up*\n- Transfer where a chunk in one field is very similar to another field (handstands, learning, guitar\n- There are two types of ways to think about a problem Sequential (focused mode) and holistic/global (diffuse). Its a good idea to check the holistic thinking actually makes sense by validating using the sequential mode \n- **Lady luck favors the one who tries** its not always easy. It just gets easier the more you try\n\n*KH: Note to self. Revisiting a thought or idea isn't bad. Bring it up again and ask people if your new understanding is correct. You know you dwell on things long after the conversation ends but new ideas form. Its a good thing*\n\n#Procrastination and Memory\n\n##Tackling procrastination - It's Easier and More Valuable than you think\nWhen you're thinking doing something you find difficult your brain automatically responds by lighting up areas associated to actual physical pain. However, once you start very quickly the pain sensations will go away.\n\nProcrastination is a terrible habit that builds. The more you succumb to it the more painful it'll be subsequent times you try NOT to procrastinate. Also as you procrastinate you're brain automatically rationalises reasons of why the material is hard, or that you shouldn't be studying it and the more you do it, then the better you get at it. By mastering procrastination you make yourself effective at getting things done.\n\nWhen learning or working. Eat the frog. If you do the hardest most difficult thing first it'll be easier in the end.\n\n##Zombies Everywhere\nYou have limited willpower. Which is why most of the time you spend you're in zombie mode.\nWhich are your habits. And you want them to work for you not against you. And they need to be built like chunks\nThere are 4 stages to a habit\n1. The Cue - This is the emotion/environment/event that causes you to trigger your habit \n*KH: you know how you reach towards junk food when you study?*\n2. The Routine - This is what you start doing once the cue triggers the habit\n3. The Reward - This makes your brain feel good when you get to do the process. Almost like satisfying an itch. In procrastination its basically moving away from your initial task\n4. The belief - Knowing that this habit is you or can become you. And trust the process. Meaning you can change and build new zombies. YAY! *KH: Is this 4 steps to a habit or 4 parts? because I don't know where this one fits in*\n\n##Surf's Up: Process Versus Product\nYour brain feels pain when it thinks about physical things that make it uncomfortable. So for example thinking about a report, or a thesis. The goal can seem overwhelming. Sometimes its uncomfortable when you're about to start a subject you like.\nf you instead focus on process \"I'll work on the report for one pomodoro\" it becomes MUCH more palettable for your brain. *KH: it might also become more useful in figuring out how long it takes to do bits of work*\n\nUse your pomodoros to help you. Find good environments to support your work.\nRemove yourself from bad enviroments cues and distractions. So switch off your phone, don't check your email and remove snacks from the area. This way when you work. You're working\nIf you setup good habits then it'll be more painful not to do the right thing!\n\n##Harnessing Your Zombies to Help You\n*KH: I feel like I've talked about this already*\nYou don't want to change all your habits. Just a few. And to do that you just need to modify your response to a cue.\nCues are usually:\n- locations\n- times\n- Your feelings\n- an event in your environment\n\nRemoving cues can be especially effective in training zombies\n\nOnce you know your cues. You can change your response to it. but you need a plan. It may often fail. But that's OK. when it works. Celebrate!\n\nReward. This comes in the celebration part, give youself a mental break. meditate, or a treat, or give yourself some words of encouragement \"WELL DONE KEVIN\". Maybe Amy cuddy it and fist pump!\nScale the reward as well for hard work!\n\nYou must believe that you can do it. Community can help you do things. Like accountability buddies. And they help you remember that we're all human and we sometimes fail.\n\n\n\n##Juggling Life and Learning\n- Have a planner journal\n- Set weekly goals\n- Before sleeping each night review your goals. Maybe break it down to specific tasks.\n- Plan your quitting time\n- Leisuire time is important. Mix up learnign with physical activity\n- Eat your frogs first\n\n##Summing up Procrastination\n- Keep a planner journal\n- Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day (pratce commitment)\n- Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate *KH:like accountability buddy...what else??*\n- Eat the frog first\n- Gain Trust in the System\n- Setup routines or habits (work and play time) \n- Delay rewards until you finish the task\n\n#Memory\n\n##Diving Deeper into Memory\nOur memory are built around our visual systems. We can remember images much better than we can abstract concepts. So use metaphors analogies and try to imagine yourself inside the concept. As you do, engage the image by imagining what you would hear, feel, smell and sense.\n\nThen recall that memory later one. Flash cards are helpful. Creating or drawing the cards helps your brain remember. and then say it aloud ot build auditory cues. Then use the card periodically. See if you can recall the material put the card away. Once you have built a deck. Mix them up and see if you can remember. This helps interleaving. Anki is agreat program to help do this for you.\n\n##What is Long Term Memory?\nLong term memory is when you can recall new experiences or enviroments. It is very dependant on your hippocampus. Memories are strengthened through a process called reconsolidation. However each time you remember things the memory is slightly altered. You can even make false memories indistinguishable from real ones.\n\n##Creating Meaningful Groups and the Memory Palace Technique\nCreate nmeonics or anagrams to help you remember.\nAssociate numbers or dates with meaningful envents in your life *KH like Mark's stupid way  of  remembering '7260'. Its a 720 spin, followed by a 360 spin. Just miss out the middle stuff*\n\nThe memory palace technique is way to remember list of many unrelated items. \n1. Think of a place you know very well. For example your home\n2. Imagine yourself walking through the home.\n3. For each item you want to remember put a ridiculous image in your head. i.e. you need to buy a dozen eggs at the store. Have an eggexcute rolling around demanding to be in the cart. The more visual, audiable, smellable, touchable the idea the stronger that item will stay in your memory.\n4. As you walk through your home in the same order you'll be able to recall the items in the list.\n5. The more you practice your palace the better you'll be at it.\n\nUse your childlike creativity. It'll serve you well.\n\n#Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential I\n\n\n##How to become a better learner\nHere are some tips\n- Exercise! It helps you build neurons!\n- Critical periods of learning\n- First language acquisition - Up to puberty\n- Steropsis (depth perception) 2 years of age *KH:I might be a bit messed up here*\n- The prefrontal cortex where planning, complex analysis, decision making and social interaction occurs is the last art to mature. There are lots of 'Zombies' in here\n\n##Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential\nLearning is not linear. Sometimes you'll reach a plateau and it seems like things you use to understand no longer makes sense. This could be a period of when your brain restructures. Just be persistent and keeping working at it. You'll get better.\n\n##Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy\nWhen you want to remember something and understand concepts. Associate it with a very visual metaphor *KH: Cake chef as an example of solar panels!*\nThe more animated you make the metaphor or analogy the more likely it'll stick. Try to engage your senses and emotions to the idea to help it stick more. And pretend you're the object you're trying to understand. And experience what it feels like as the concept.\n\nAlso sometimes you'll need an analogy or metaphor just to begin. But when your understanding reaches a point where it no longer makes sense. You can discard it for another one.\n\nIt is also useful for getting your thought pattern out of einstellung.\n\n##No Need for Genius Envy\nRepetition ultimately makes you learn things properly.\n\nSometimes your expertise gets so good you dont' focus on it and you forget about why you do things but just rely on your well trained diffuse mode to solve the problem.\n\nSome people have more working memory than others.\n\nSome people can't hold much in their working memeory but are far more creative with the chunks once they form them. Both is ok.\n\nDon't worry about what other people know. Or what you feel like you SHOULD know. Just keep working on it. You might feel like an imposter at first. But the more your practice eventually you will become capable. Have faith. Keep working hard.\n\n##Change Your Thoughts, Change your Life\n\n#Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential II\n\n##The Value of Teamwork\n\n##A Test Checklist\nWhen you're doing tasks you're unfamiliar with it can be daunting. \nBefore taking tests summurise the main ideas you wish to tackle and work through the items one by one. This is like focusing on process not product because you can break down things into small managable bites.\n\nChecklists can work for tests or any other situations like reports to make sure you're prepared and ready to deliver.\n\nPilots and doctors do it all the time before flight and surgery because its important. You can utilise this technique too!\n\n##Hard Start - Jump to Easy\nWhen tackling a test (or a set of problems). Read through all of them and try and do the hardest one first. Give it focused attention for a while. When you've done as much as you can. Leave it and go onto the other questions. What happens is that you're priming your brain to work on the problem in the diffuse mode. So while you're working on the easier problems and going through them your brain will try and work out the hard one. When you come back to it later you'll find that you might be able to do more or the whole thing!\n\n##Final Helpful Hints for Tests\n\n#MY Summary Sections\n\n##Overview\n- Concepts (Short and long term memory, Focused/diffuse mode, Chunking, Illusions of Competance, habits/zombies)\n- Brain chemistry (brainfacts!
