Because I'm learning that too through the Coursera Data Science Specialisation in hopes to build skills as a data scientist.\n\n##About this pack\nThe content of this pack is designed to serve as a summary or a cheat sheet. \n\nThe course itself was (cleverly) designed to using the lessons taught in the course. I reccommend going hrough the course to get a feel for a material and to use this pack as reference only.\n\nOccasionally you'll see italics like this *KH: a thought*. These are my thoughts and musings about the subject matter.\n\nThanks for reading, learning, and caring for your future.\n\nLets go!\n\n##Contents\n- Focused vs Diffuse Learning  \n- Procrastination Memory, Sleep\n- Chunking the Essentials\n- Seeing the bigger picture\n- Procrastination\n- Memory\n- Renaissance Learning and unlocking your Potential I\n- Renaissance Learning and unlocking your Potential II\n\n#Focused vs Diffuse Learning\n\n\n##Introduction to the Focused and Diffuse Modes \nYou are only able to be in one of the two following modes of thinking at a time.\n\n###Focused Learning\nWhen there are a limited number of ideas that your mind can managed at a time. It requires intense concentration and is helpful to execute a process or idea you know well. Metaphors are especially useful to build mental hooks as you can link it to other senses ie sight, smell, sound, touch which is much more powerful in your memory.\n\n###Diffuse learning\nWhen your mind is more relaxed. Perhaps focused on something else. But allows tthe ideas explored during the focused learning mode to be creatively combined. This is especially useful when exploring new ideas or concepts.\n\n##Using the focused and diffuse Modes - Or, a little Dali will do you\nSalvidor Dali and Thomas Edison were great utilisers of the diffuse modes of thinking. They'd work hard and when they needed a break they'd sit in their chair with a key (or ball bearing) in their hand until they nearly fall asleep and they'd drop the object. That would wake them up and they'd immediately jump back into focused modes of thinking.\n\nLearning takes time and spending that time and effort to grapple new ideas in both modes of thinking is an essential part of that exercise.\n\n##What is learning?\nUsing brain imaging you can see different parts of your brain light up under different circumstances. When you're focused the areas around the edges of the brain light up. When you're resting the inner part of your brain \"default mode network\" light up. *KH:Is this where our habits live?*\n\nYour brain is a living organ. When you sleep new dendrites are created along synapses. Especially after focused learning. Its like getting an upgrade of your brain each time you sleep. \n\n#Procrastination, Memory and Sleep\n##A Procrastination Review\nWhen you think about doing a task that you would rather not do. The pain areas of your brain light up.\nThis is procrastination and you seek out distractions *KH: reddit, youtube, facebook, emails etc* that your brain feels better when you do them.\n\nInterestingly if you go ahead and do the task anyway the pain points disappear quickly.\n\nThis is why the pomodoro technique is effective. Just set a timer and sit down for 25mins and do the task. At the end of the 25mins take a 5 minute break and reward yourself. This gets your brain used to doing small bits of work.\n\n##Practice Makes Permanent\n*KH: Barbara Oakley was not a natural at learning maths and science. This ties into Tim Ferris's\nadvice to learn from those who should not be good at something. They're the ones that would know how to get better best*\n\nWhen you want to learn something. Try it hard for a while, then take a break. Give some time for the mental motar in the mental wall to set. Before revising the material again. Don't cram or nothing will stick.\n\n*KH: for me one example is learning emtional language and mastery. Knowing how to harness and manage my emotions allows me to utilise them effectively to understand and achieve my goals.*\n\n##Introduction into memory\nThere are two types of memory. Working memory and long term memory. You can only hold about 4 things in your working memory at a time. So you can't really hold anymore than that many ideas while working in your focused mode. Also the ideas in your working memory are fragile so like remembering a long number you have to keep repeating them in your head or closing your eyes to remove distractions to try and remember them.\n\nIn long term memory you can have billions of things in there. But it takes time to get them out. So using spaced repetition is an effective way to maintain the memories in there. Its much better to repeat the recall of ideas over time than to pull them out the same number of times in one day.\n\n##The Importance of Sleep in Learning\nWhen you are awake your brain is producing toxins in your brain. By going to sleep your brain cells shrink to allow fluid to wash away the metabolic toxins. The toxins are linked to many negative outcomes and they also make your brain not work very well.\n\nWhen you sleep you brain also strengthens things you have tried to learn. To improve your chances of learning being focused on the topic right before you sleep helps your brain make connections. Even futrther if you make it intentional *KH: how does one actually do this??* that you will dream about what you were learning. You'll further increase your chances of an event.\n\nThis technique can make a remarkable difference in your ability to learn.\n\n#Chunking\n##Introduction into Chunking\n",
